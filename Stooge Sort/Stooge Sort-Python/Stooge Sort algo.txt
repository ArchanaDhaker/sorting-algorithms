The Stooge sort is a recursive sorting algorithm. It is defined as below (for ascending order sorting).

Step 1 : If value at index 0 is greater than
         value at last index, swap them.
Step 2:  Recursively, 
       a) Stooge sort the initial 2/3rd of the array.
       b) Stooge sort the last 2/3rd of the array.
       c) Stooge sort the initial 2/3rd again to confirm.

Illustration:

Input :   2 4 5 3 1
Output : 1 2 3 4 5
Explanation:
Initially, swap 2 and 1 following above step 1.
          1 4 5 3 2
          Now, recursively sort initial 2/3rd of the elements.
          1 4 5 3 2
          1 3 4 5 2 
          Then, recursively sort last 2/3rd of the elements.
          1 3 4 5 2
          1 2 3 4 5
          Again, sort the initial 2/3rd of the elements to confirm final data is sorted.
          1 2 3 4 5
